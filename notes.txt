Run the entire stack with a single command from the root directory:

chmod +x run_app.sh
./run_app.sh
This launches the FastAPI backend on port 8000 and the Vite/React frontend on port 5173.

The System Architecture

The platform is designed with a "Security-First" approach to handle data from multiple clients simultaneously.
- The Secure Handshake (Auth)
- The system uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to power its dynamic routing:
- Login: Users receive a token containing their unique company_id.
- Isolation: Every database query is filtered by this ID. User A can never see User B's bugs, even though they share the same physical database.
- Dynamic UI: The dashboard automatically calculates statistics based only on the data belonging to the logged-in user's company.

The AI Engine (ML & RAG)

Severity Prediction: A Random Forest model (rf_model.pkl) analyzes report text to predict severity (S1-S4) with a confidence score.
Duplicate Detection: Uses ChromaDB and Sentence Transformers to perform a vector search. It finds similar bugs based on semantic meaning (context) rather than just keyword matching.

🛠️ First-Time Installation

If you have just pulled this repository, follow these steps to initialize your local environment:

1. Backend Setup

cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Create the database and admin user
./setup_db.sh 

2. Frontend Setup

cd frontend
npm install

Technology Stack
Frontend: React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Lucide Icons.
Backend: FastAPI (Python), SQLAlchemy ORM.
Database: PostgreSQL (Relational data), ChromaDB (Vector/AI data).
ML/AI: Scikit-Learn (Random Forest), Sentence Transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2).

Important Security Notes

Local Database: The rag_db/ and local .sqlite files are ignored by Git to prevent data corruption. Use setup_db.sh to generate your local tables.
Sensitive Data: Ensure your .env file in the backend contains the correct DATABASE_URL for your local PostgreSQL instance and is never pushed to the public repo.
